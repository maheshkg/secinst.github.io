The Open Software Instrumentation Project is a free and open community dedicated on harnessing the magic and power of software instrumentation (SI). We learn, code, share, create tools, build community, and more. Join us!

> In the real world, we *instrument* complex things like cars, airplanes, factories, space shuttles, etc...  It would be irresponsible and crazy to operate these things without great instrumentation -- we'd have no way to know what's going on. But software is arguably the most complex thing ever created by humanity, and we have terrible instrumentation. Traditional logging is nowhere near what we need.

We think of SI as a new way to think about how modern software is assembled. Instead of attempting to get all developers try to remember and manually replicate the right patterns and idioms everywhere, SI is a modular and elegant way deliver exactly the right code to exactly where it needs to be.

> ***Terminology:*** SI lets you target specific locations in your application by defining a *"pointcut."* You can enhance the code in those locations with an *"advice."* The actual locations where code modification occurs are called *"join points."*

Some people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(computer_programming)">think</a> SI is just for adding performance timers or extra logging to applications. But it's actually far more powerful than that. SI can help achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>, modularity, performance, security, scalability, and more. There's really no limit to how you can enhance software using instrumentation. 

# Join Us

We need your help. Whether you're a student, security expert, performance engineer, or a grizzled compiler designer, if you're interested in SI you can join us and help us advance the state-of-the-art. Pick a topic, do some research, and share what you learn. {HERE FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON CONTRIBUTING}
