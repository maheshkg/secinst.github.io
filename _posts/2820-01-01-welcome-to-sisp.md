The Open Software Instrumentation Project is a free and open community dedicated on harnessing the magic and power of instrumentation to make software simpler, more powerful, and more secure. We learn, code, share, create tools, build community, and more. Join us!

**Instrumentation** - In the real world, we *instrument* complex things like cars, airplanes, factories, space shuttles, etc...  It would be irresponsible and crazy to operate these things without great instrumentation -- we'd have no way to know what's going on. But software is arguably the most complex thing ever created by humanity, and we have terrible instrumentation. Traditional logging is nowhere near powerful or flexible enough.

**Software Instrumentation** is a safe and powerful technique to enhance software without changing any code. Most modern software platforms provide built-in instrumentation support and there are many libraries to help make it simple to use. Instrumentation is widely used for performance, security, and in application frameworks... and the sky is the limit for this powerful technique:
* Add performance sensors
* Add security defenses in exactly the right places
* Add vulnerability testing
* Add checks to make sure your coding patterns are followed
* And much more...
