The Open Software Instrumentation Project is a free and open community dedicated on harnessing the magic and power of instrumentation to make software simpler, more powerful, and more secure. We learn, code, share, create tools, build community, and more. Join us!

**Instrumentation** - In the real world, we *instrument* complex things like cars, airplanes, factories, space shuttles, etc...  It would be irresponsible and crazy to operate these things without great instrumentation. We would never know what is going on. But software, arguably the most complex thing ever created by humanity, has terrible instrumentation in general and *almost no security instrumentation*. Traditional logging is nowhere near powerful or flexible enough.

**Software Instrumentation** is a safe and powerful technique to enhance software without changing any code. Most modern software platforms provide built-in instrumentation support and there are many libraries to help make it simple to use. Instrumentation is widely used for performance, security, and in application frameworks... but the sky is the limit for this powerful technique.
