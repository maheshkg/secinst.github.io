The Open Security Instrumentation Project is a free and open community dedicated to ensuring that the software of the world is instrumented for security. We learn, code, share, create tools, build community, and more. Join us!

In the real world, we *instrument* complex things like cars, airplanes, factories, space shuttles, etc...  It would be irresponsible and crazy to operate these things without great instrumentation. We would never know what is going on. But software, arguably the most complex thing ever created by humanity, has terrible instrumentation in general and *almost no security instrumentation*. Traditional logging is nowhere near powerful or flexible enough.

**Software Instrumentation** is a safe and powerful technique for adding capabilities to existing software without changing any code. Instrumentation "sensors" directly measure running software while "actuators" can actually make changes.  Most modern software platforms provide built-in instrumentation support and there are many libraries to help make it simple to use.  Many frameworks already use instrumentation to simplify coding patterns and it is widely used for application performance monitoriing tools.

**Security Instrumentation** is simply the use of software instrumentation for security purposes. It's easy and safe and amazingly powerful. There's almost no limit to what you can do with security instrumentation. You can...
* Gather interesting security information directly from an application
* Perform security testing, finding vulnerabilities, and generating assurance
* Detect attacks and even prevent entire classes of exploits

Watch this video for an introduction to the magic of software security instrumentation.
